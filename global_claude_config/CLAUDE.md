# Global Instructions

## Delegation

Prefer delegating work to subagents using the Task tool when the task involves:
- Editing or creating more than 2 files
- Multi-step implementation (build + test + validate)
- Research that requires broad codebase exploration
- Parallel workstreams that can run concurrently

Do the work directly (without subagents) for:
- Simple single-file edits or fixes
- Quick lookups or reads
- Answering questions
- Git operations (commit, push, PR)
